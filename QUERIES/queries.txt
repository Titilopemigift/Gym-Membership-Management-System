1. List all members and their membership types:

SELECT first_name, last_name, membership_type
FROM members;

2. Find all classes a specific member attended:

SELECT m.first_name, m.last_name, c.class_name, ca.attendance_date
FROM class_attendance ca
JOIN members m ON ca.member_id = m.member_id
JOIN classes c ON ca.class_id = c.class_id
WHERE m.first_name = 'John' AND m.last_name = 'Doe';


3. Find which trainer is leading which class:

SELECT c.class_name, t.first_name, t.last_name
FROM class_trainers ct
JOIN classes c ON ct.class_id = c.class_id
JOIN trainers t ON ct.trainer_id = t.trainer_id;

4. Calculate total subscription fees from all members:

SELECT SUM(subscription_fee) AS total_fees
FROM memberships;
